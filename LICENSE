### Modifications

The following modifications were made to the original software by Henriquelima1:
- Adapted the code for compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 14.04.
- Ensured compatibility with GCC versions from 4.8 to 7.

### Usage on Ubuntu 14.04

The `boost-regex`, `libnetsnmp` and `libnetsnmpagent` libraries are **only used on Ubuntu 14.04**. They are only needed on this specific version of the operating system, where the project depends on them to function correctly. **On later versions of Ubuntu, these libraries are not used**, and the code will work without external dependencies related to these libraries.
